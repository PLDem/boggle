An ASCII version of the popular board game. It is run in the terminal and programmed in Java.

This program was written for the Data Structures class, which I am currently taking, in order to explore the use of the
map abstract data type. 

Run it in the terminal by executing either OnePlayer.java or TwoPlayer.java. In OnePlayer, the
computer finds all possible words in the generated board. TwoPlayer allows the user to play a game against the computer.
Add a number after the executable name in order to get the same board each time, i.e. "java OnePlayer 0" will generate
the same board each time because the "randomly" placed letters will be placed using the same seed number each time.
